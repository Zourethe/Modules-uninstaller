# Modules Uninstaller

This is a python module uninstaller, it uninstalls all modules that appear in the "pip freeze" list.

The only thing you need to do to use it is run the file.

In the console it will show the uninstall mensage of all modules. 

Sometimes you may get an error message at first, but it will still work correctly.
